# ARM Autonomous Robot Challenge Documentation

The idea is to use a Donkeycar as a service robot inside a home.
Some initial thoughts for a use case are  

* Detect and track people and pets
* Keep an eye on the pet(s) and report abnormal activities to the owner


#### Technical areas of focus
* Visual SLAM
* Sensor Fusion
* Controls of the Donkeycar
